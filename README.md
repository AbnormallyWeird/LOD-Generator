# LOD-Generator

The issue I'm looking to solve for is the fact that challonge.com does not have a function to randomly create teams from a list of participants. This is very common for dart tournaments. You show up at the venue and signup. When it's time to start they will pair you up with someone else at random and your team will then compete in a bracket tournament. Challonge.com solves for the bracket part but does not have functionality to create random teams from a signup page. My hope is this can be used to bridge that gap.
